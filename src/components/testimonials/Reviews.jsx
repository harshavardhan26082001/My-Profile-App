        "I had the chance to closely work with Harsha and lead him in many projects. The impression I have of him from the point when he joined UnDosTres as an intern straight from college till the last day at UnDosTres is quite positive. I really like his never giving attitude and always eager to work on challenging tasks. He has carved a great learning curve in the time he has worked at UnDosTres. And I believe he will continue to grow. Along with professional skills, I would also say that Harsha is a great guy with a very positive outlook to life. I recommend him to anyone looking for a team player and a great potential leader.",
